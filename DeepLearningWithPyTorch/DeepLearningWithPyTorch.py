Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were all the rage at image classification challenges from about 2014 to 2017.
They were bested by recurrent convolutional neural networks (RNNs) from 2017 to 2020.

In 2017 a paper called "Attention is all you need" was published by Ashish Vaswani et. al which proposed the existence
of transformer architectures. Transformers set the world of ai / ml alight and have been responsible for a significant
amount of new developments in the field since 2020.

What follows below is a humble example of simple CNNs trained against the CIFAR10 data set with the goal of
arrurately classifying 60,000 images into 10 categories.
